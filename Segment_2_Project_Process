Our Project is about trying to predict if a person taking a COVID vaccine is going to have a serious adverse reaction or not given features such as existing allergies, 
current medication, age and gender. Our output value here is our symptoms and we plan on predicting the severity of it. 

## Data Source
 - Our data source is from HHS Vaers website - https://vaers.hhs.gov/data/datasets.html?
 - We downloaded the latest available data for 2020 and 2021
 - We have 3 files for 2020 ( Vaersdata, vaerssymptoms, vaersvax) and the same 3 files for 2021
 - We then used Python and pandas library to merge the same tables for both the years to have  master table for each of the above.


## Data Cleaning
 - Each member of the team took one of the three master files and started the cleaning process.
 - We first dropped the data that was not related to the COVID-19 vaccination.
 - Information on Vaccination was only in our vaersvax source file so we had to merge that file with the other two files on Vaers_id in order to drop non Covid records.
 - We created three seperate clean data tables for Allergies, Medication and Symptoms to use as X and Y values to train and test our model. 
 - All of our cleaning process were done in a jupyter notebook and then the static data was saved into our database.
 - We connected our machine learning model to our database to read the clean tables and do our analysis.
 - Each table we created in the database has descriptions under the properties section explaining the join/merge creteria used if any.

 ## Visualization & Story Board
  Our overall story and study of our analysis will let the user interact with the aggregated 
  results and filter on topics that matter most to them.
  Our interactive dashboard will be hosted on Tableau Public and a user will be able to filter through gender, 
  age bucket and pre existing conditions to see their likely of having a serious adverse reaction.


## The Bottom Line
COVID-19 vaccines help our bodies develop immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19 without us having to get the illness. 
Getting vaccinated is one of many steps you can take to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.  Protection from COVID-19 
is critically important because for some people, COVID-19 can cause severe illness or death as seen by our study.
